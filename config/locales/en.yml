      p1: "A hat is a formal, verified way of speaking officially for a project, organization, or company on Lobsters.
          A user can have more than one hat, but only wear one at a time on a comment or private message."
      p2: "Hats are for making public statements, not commemorating contributions to a project or jobs held.
          Please request one only if you'll be acting offically here, like if you're a core project developer or company employee authorized to post on behalf of your organization.
          Hats are usually reserved for notable projects and organizations."
      p3: 'To request a hat for your account, provide a short description of the hat
          (e.g., "OpenBSD Developer"), a public link that will be shown when hovering
          over the hat that users can see, such as your e-mail address at that project
          or company, or a link to a company website showing your employment, and
          private comments that will be seen only by moderators during approval.'
      p4: "It's really helpful if you link your GitHub or Twitter account to your Lobsters account and,
          in your comment, link to where the organization links to that public account.
          Then we can instantly see you're legit without having to send a verification email."
      p5: "When you can no longer speak for a project or company, please contact a moderator to doff your hat.
          Old messages will still show it and you won't be able to use it again."
